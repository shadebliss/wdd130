                <img src="/wdd130/wwr/images/Paro-Chhu-Bhutan.jpg" alt="" width="200">
                <p>This is the least known river on the list since very few people are able to visit Bhutan due to their “High Value and Low Volume” tourist policy. However, for those that have rafted it, this river is legendary due to its beautiful Class IV rapids, crystal-clear water, and a memorable side hike up to an active monastery.</p>

                <h3>Airplane-Turn-Cal-Salmon River</h3><br>

                <p>The Cal Salmon is a stunningly beautiful river that flows between two wilderness areas in the coast range of Northern California. The Nordheimer section has three big Class V rapids surrounded by a ton of classic Class IVs. There is also great whitewater downstream on the Butler section and the nearby Ikes section of the Klamath River.</p>

                <p>The Neretva is a crystal-clear Class III river flowing through a stunning, vertically walled canyon with many amazing waterfalls cascading into the river. It is simply breathtaking and easily Bosnia’s best rafting trip in a country full of amazing rafting trips.</p>
